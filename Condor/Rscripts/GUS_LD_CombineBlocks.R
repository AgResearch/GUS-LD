#### R script that takes the LD blocks generated using the 'GUS_LD_CondorRun.R',
#### combines them into a half matrix and saves to an RData file.

### Function that takes a list of LDblocks and combines them into a matrix. 
### Note: It assumes that the blocks are to be added sequentially down a column
combineBlocks <- function(List,blocks){
  nb <- nrow(unique(blocks[,1:2]))
  bLen <- blocks[1:nb,4]-blocks[1:nb,3]+1
  
  LDmat <- do.call(rbind,List[c(1:nb)])
  for(i in seq(from=1,length.out=(nb-1))){
    addBlock <- matrix(0,nrow=sum(bLen[1:i]),ncol=bLen[i+1])
    LDmat <- cbind(LDmat,do.call(rbind,c(list(addBlock),List[seq(from=sum(nb+1-1:i)+1,length.out=nb-i)])))
  }
  return(LDmat)
}


#### First generate a list that contains all the subblocks that we need and combine to get a matrix.
for(LDmeasure in c('Dprime','r2')){

  blockList <- list() #list to contain all the LDblocks
  ## read in the block matrix
  blocks <- matrix(scan(paste("./",runName,"/LDblocks/BlockMat.txt",sep="")),byrow=T,ncol=4)
  
  # Now out the blocks into a list.
  for(blockNo in 1:nrow(blocks)){
    blockList <- c(blockList,list(as.matrix(read.table(paste("./",runName,"/LDblocks/",LDmeasure,"_Block",blockNo,".txt",sep="")))))
  }
  
  # combine the blocks into a matrix
  LDmat <- combineBlocks(blockList,blocks)
  
  ### If required. Turn the half matrix into a full symmetric matrix 
  diag(LDmat) <- 100
  LDmat[upper.tri(LDmat)] <- t(LDmat)[upper.tri(t(LDmat))]
  
  ### covert data to actural floats instead of integers and save an RData file
  assign(LDmeasure,unname(LDmat)/100)
}

## save to an R workspace
save('Dprime','r2',file=paste(runName,"/",runName,"_LDmat.RData",sep=""))
