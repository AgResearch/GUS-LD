Genotyping Uncertainty with Sequencing data - Linkage Disequilibrium

An R package for estimating linkage disequilibrium using low and/or high coverage sequencing data without requiring filtering with respect to read depth.

### Installation:

The easiest way to install GUSMap in R is using the devtools package.

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("tpbilton/GUSbase")
install_github("tpbilton/GUS-LD")
```

Note: Some of the functions are coded in C and therefore an appropriate C compiler is needed for the package to work. For windows OS, Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) provides a compiler. 

### Tutorials:

The best way to understand how to use GUSLD is to read through the [Introduction](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tpbilton/GUSMap/blob/master/inst/doc/Introduction.html) Tutorial contained in the package.

### Development:

There are plans to contiune developing this package. If you have any suggests for improvement or additional features you like to see, I'd suggest posting a question under the Issues. I'm also happy for people to suggest changes via a pull request provided it fits within the favour of the package.
